# VapourTrail

VapourTrail is an interactive bus map made from OpenStreetMap data.

![demo](img/demo.gif)

VapourTrail aims to be a large scale or local solution for visualizing bus lines based on OpenStreetMap data composed of:
* an interactive map with a schematic bus route display
* an API for bus routes
* a tileset of vector tiles

### Dependencies

* imposm3
* postgre / postgis
* t-rex
* docker / docker-compose
* python3 with flask and SQLAlchemy

### How to run

Put an .osm.pbf file into `docker/imposm/import` directory.

Run `make docker-importer` to import the data to the Postgres database.

The first run will perform several actions:

* download all the required base images,
* build and run the containers
* create the database
* import the osm.pbf file
* execute the post_process SQL scripts

Run `make up-d` to run the services (web and api) in detached mode.

The tiles rendered by t-rex are available at `http://localhost:6767/`.

The web front-end is available at `http://localhost:8082/vapour_trail.html`.

The API (used by the front-end) is available at `http://localhost:5000`. The endpoint used is `/routes/<string:route_id>`.

**Troubleshooting**: If you don't see the name of the bus stops on the map after import or if the bus stop popups are empty, try to restart t-rex service: `docker-compose restart t-rex`

If you have performance issues, you may want to pre-generate the tiles before using the front : `make generate-tiles bbox=minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat`

### Deploy a static version

To get a static version (that can work without t-rex and postgres):

* import data: `make docker-importer`
* generate tiles for your area of interest: `make generate-tiles bbox=minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat`
* prepare static publication: `make prepare-static static_url=http://localhost/tile`
* you can now deploy and serve the `static` folder

### Style Edition

The background style is in `web/glstyle.json` while the foreground style is in `web/vapour-style.json`. Both can be edited manually or with style editor.

With the t-rex tiles server running locally you can upload `vapour-style.json` to the online [Maputnik Editor](http://editor.openmaptiles.org) and exported back.
